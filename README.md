# OBS Example Python Scripts

NOTE: These are prototypes to
sight in on a final script. They're
useful for that purpose and can
work as basic examples in some
cases but that's not their primary
purpose.

TODO: Rename the Repo from Examples
to Prototypes.

NOTE: The scripts get more and more
complete as they go on. The early
ones aren't as solid as the later
ones.

NOTE: This is a draft/scratchpad.
I've got the parts I need. Keeping
it public, but it's not cleaned up.

NOTE: These don't all have the cleanup
reference calls in them. I don't know
how critical that is for one off scripts.
Probably something to address regardless.

An example set of python scripts for working
with basic OBS functionality.

I'm not trying to make a full set of example.
This is just what I'm using as a scratchpad
for figuring out the parts I need.

The example use a "Test Source".

NOTE:

I'm using this to release the scene:

```python
obs.obs_scene_release(scene)
```

I'm not yet sure if anything else needs to be
released or not.
